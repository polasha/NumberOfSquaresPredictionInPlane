# NumberOfSquaresPredictionInPlane
computer program which solves how many squares can be formed, given n random points (int x,y values) in a plane.

For finding the number of squares on given random points, 
in the beginning, I set the number of tests, how many times we can test for one's time. 

After that, I have defined the number of point pairs that how many point
pairs we want to give as an input. 

And I have created the list to store the points.

For solving this problem, I have considered, firstly, square aligned with axes, then consider non-aligned squares. I have written the math
expression in python script with comments.
